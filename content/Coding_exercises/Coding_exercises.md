### Some comments:
What is this repository about?

Here I’ll be uploading LeetCode exercises and solving each one using both brute-force and optimized approaches — or the only one that I know at that moment. The goal is to demonstrate how to improve code efficiency while gaining experience at coding — a skill that’s essential for cybersecurity practitioners on both sides of the field (red and blue teams).

#### Writing Optimal Code: A Cybersecurity Perspective
When developing software in the field of cybersecurity, it's important to think like a nation-state hacker. The goal isn't just to write functional code — it's to write optimal code. That means choosing minimal-complexity algorithms that use the least possible resources.

##### Offensive Security (Red Team)
In offensive security, you might find yourself writing exploits or deploying backdoors. In these situations, your code must be stealthy — it needs to leave minimal traces. The more CPU, memory, or network bandwidth your tools consume, the more likely they are to trigger monitoring systems. Once flagged, defenders can begin analysis, detect your presence, and remove your access. That’s why red team tools must be lean, fast, and efficient.


When you're injecting code, it must be done with the smallest possible resource footprint and within the narrowest window of opportunity.
You need to **"be like water, my friend"** — flowing silently through cracks in the system and adapting to every environment as water does flowing between rocks, trees, caves and any other element in nature.

##### Defensive Security (Blue Team)
On the defensive side, you're responsible for monitoring and protecting infrastructure — ideally with minimal spenditure. Efficient code matters because every unnecessary cycle or byte costs money and affects system performance. You want lightweight, reliable tools that can scale across systems without breaking the budget.

##### Why Optimal Code Matters
Whether you're attacking or defending, optimal code isn’t just a best practice — it’s a necessity. Even Dictionary Attacks (read team) or Intrusion Detection Systems (blue team)  should be optimized using heuristics or smarter algorithms.

So, after this being said, let's begin with the coding!
